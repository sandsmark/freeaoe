[![screenshot](/doc/screenshot-small.png)](/doc/screenshot.png)

freeaoe is a project to write a free engine capable of running Age of Empires 2
(and other Genie games like SW:GB eventually).

The project is still in early development. But you can load and play scenarios,
show the history screen, move around, attack, build and stuff.  There are some
screenshots in the [doc/](doc/) folder.

It (obviously) needs the original data files, but it works with the data
files from the trial version (e. g. from Archive.org).

Windows
-------
Automated Windows builds can be [downloaded from AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sandsmark/freeaoe/build/artifacts).

There is no installation, it's just a zip file with a standalone .exe that you
run.

NB: If Appveyor says there's no artifact available it's probably because it's
building the latest version, just give it a few moments (or click around in
AppVeyor to find the older versions).

Caveat emptor; I don't have any Windows installation to test with, but it
works fine in Wine.


Running
-------

If you have AoE2 installed it should automatically detect where it is installed
and load the data files automatically (looking up in the Windows registry). If
that doesn't work for some reason it will pop up a dialog where you can point
it to the files manually.

If you don't have it installed there's a nice button in that dialog which opens
[an URL](https://archive.org/details/AgeOfEmpiresIiTheConquerorsDemo) where you
can download the trial version of AoC. It doesn't have the higher resolution
graphics e. g. for the UI, though, so I highly recommend getting an original CD
with the full version.

On Linux it parses the Wine registry file to try to find the installation,
otherwise you get the same dialog (but with a handy button to go directly to
the .wine folder). Be aware that it respects WINEPREFIX, so make sure that is
set correctly if you use it.


Dependencies
------------
 - SFML
 - Modern C++ compiler

To build
--------
 - Clone with --recurse-submodules (e. g. `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sandsmark/freeaoe.git`)
 - `mkdir build && cd build`
 - `cmake .. && make -j$(nproc)`
 - `./freeaoe`

I can't get it to build on macOS (and I don't have any Apple machines), so if
you manage to get it to build please open a PR. It seems like Apple ships a
really outdated version of Clang that doesn't support modern C++.

Although I also have some rights to reverse engineer works I have the right to

not familiar enough with the laws governing reverse engineering that Github is

Misc
----

This is mostly a single-person pet project, so if you want a more serious project,
try [openage](https://openage.sft.mx/).

It uses the same [library](https://github.com/sandsmark/genieutils) as [AGE
(Advanced Genie Editor)](https://github.com/sandsmark/AGE), so it should be able to
handle anything that can be edited by that (and therefore basically all
community content created for AoE2). Because of this it doesn't need to unpack
or convert anything, all data files are used as is.

This repo is originally a fork of https://github.com/apreiml/freeaoe, but
because a lot of stuff doesn't like working on forked repos it is now created
as a separate repo.


TODO (this is probably going to get outdated)
----
 - Proper victory screen.
 - Unit grouping/formations.
 - Patrolling.
 - Campaign cinematics (mainly just parse the .mm files).
 - Random map RMS script parsing and generating.
 - Performance (especially the path finding).
 - Various refactoring (move VisibilityMap out into separate file, rendering of units out from UnitManager, etc.)
 - Fix edges of walls when dragging.
 - Rest of AI script actions and conditions:
    - town-under-attack
    - cc-players-unit-type-count (AI cheat)
    - game-time
    - timer-triggered
    - difficulty
    - dropsite-min-distance
    - resource-found
    - players-stance
 - Angle of arrows
 - Arrows stuck in the ground
 - Upscale shaders (WIP in the `martin/lolshaders` branch)
 - Video support, intro videos etc. (WIP in the `martin/video` branch)

Wishlist/low priority:
 - Proper support for new terrain graphics (Rise of the Rajas stopped shipping the old ones).
 - Map analysis stuff (for RMS and AI).

Done
----
Not exhaustive list, mostly in addition to "normal" RTS things, or things not available in other re-implementations.
